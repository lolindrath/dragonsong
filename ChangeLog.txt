Dragonsong - General Purpose MUD Client

Version 0.4.2 - 08/31/2006
	* Fixed a bug in the MudList where it tried to close a null XmlTextReader

Version 0.4.2 - 08/12/2006
	* Used a different scroll to bottom function, we'll see how that works out

Version 0.4.2 - 03/18/2006
	* Fixed the mudlist io problem

Version 0.4.1 - 11/20/2005
	* Fixed a form resizing problem when using an XP Theme vs. Windows Classic Theme
	* Upgraded to Visual Studio 2005

Version 0.4 - 04/01/05
	* Fixed QuickConnect was not saving its data past form.close()
	* QuickConnect now checks that the port is a valid range
	* QuickConnect now catches any errors from int.Parse() to check for a bad int
	* Put these changes in ConnectionManager() also
	* Changed HistorySize to use the above method of error checking
	* Clicking the website on the SplashScreen now brings up lolindrath.com
	* Added a bad hack to prevent two connections trying to use the same log file at the same time
	* made a link label out of the lolindrath.com link in FrmAbout

Version 0.4 - 12/17/04 
	* Added a default Mud to the MudList if there are none (RoE)
	* The default entry for quick connect is now planetmud.net:5005
	* Added a button to the disconnect dialog so there's now Quick Connect
		and Connection Manager
	* The quick connect window now saves its values

Version 0.4 - 12/09/04
	* Handled IOException in the Connection class incase the server forcible closes
		the connection during a recv
	* Added CurrentFont to AnsiEdit. Before it used AnsiEdit.Font which attempted to
		change the font of the whole window which wasn't working. Now it changes the
		font of all newly appended text.

Version 0.4 - 11/18/04
	* Window resizes when the cmbInput.Font changes to show big fonts
	* You can now change the input area font
	* More validation in forms
	* Various changes to make UI design better
	* All files now save in XML format
	* All preference files now save in ApplicationSettings\LolindrathDevGroup\Dragonsong\
		instead of saving at the version level
	* Added very basic logging
	* Added a log viewer

Version 0.4 - 10/21/04
	* Optimized buffer chopping - it now waits until its a third of the size
		of MaxScrollSize until it chops (so it isn't trying to chop 9 characters off)
	* Fixed buffer chopping - it actually works now and it also chops
	  to the nearest line (in reverse) so you don't get ugly half chopped text

Version 0.4 - 10/19/04
	* Added double-click handler for the connection manager mud list
	* Added delete buttons for Aliases and Macro Editor
	* Made MaxScroll and ScrollPos properties for AnsiEdit

	* Bought House
	* Bugfixes for connection manager
	* Bugfixes for bell sound
	* bugfix - now sends login script on reconnect
	* Macros are working
	* Started on aliases

Version 0.4 - 10/11/04
	* Added the connection manager - just have to implement the rename button and some
		type of dirty flag to make sure people save and I'm done
	* Added an exit button to FrmDisconnect()
	
Version 0.4 - 10/08/04
	* Added autocomplete - hit escape and it will fill in with the closest matching
		entry in the command history.
	* Made the AnsiEdit readonly for all connections
	* Added disconnect dialog

Version 0.4 - 10/07/04
	* Added try/catches to send and recieve to handle any socket or io errors
	* Changed autoscroll so it only scrolls if you're at the very bottom of the page
	* Mapped the numberpad to the cardinal directions and 5 to the look command to make
		navigation easy
	* Fixed autoscroll - it was very broken the original way
	* Removed the txtInput - I'm no longer going to try to mask the input that way

Version 0.4 - 10/05/04
	* Fixed a problem with ANSI processing, it was in State.Esc too much and screwed
		up processing of [ on its online (thought it was a Bracket right after an Esc)
	* Handled connecting to a bad host/port
	* Fixed the Config so now when you change the font it actually changes (still need
		to really fix font changing)
	* Added a splash screen

Version 0.4 - 10/04/04
	* Fixed the Exit menu item, I never updated it after I changed to a hash
	* Made it select the tab you just added upon connection
	* Made a bunch of changes that FxCop suggested
	
Version 0.4 - 9/27/2004
	* Added the History Size Preference
	* Added the MagicLibrary TabControl, looks much sharper now
	* Now using WindowSerializer from the Genghis group to save the window position
	* Removed FrmRTF and FrmLog since I no longer need them for debugging
	* Added a ChangeLog tab to the About Box and embedded the ChangeLog
	* Added the NewDataEvent to the Connection class to get ready for Logging
	
Version 0.4 - 9/24/2004
	* Added the ability to connect to multiple MUDs (having threading issues though)
	* Fixed config saving
	* Added icons to tab pages to show incoming data on an individual window level
	* Changed Message History around - was inserting into wrong end
	
Version 0.4 - 9/23/2004
	* Made it so approximately 500 lines are in the buffer and the rest scroll
	  off into oblivion. Having too much in the AnsiEdit was causing the control
	  to AppendText() way too slow
	* Turned double buffering on to hopefully help drawing speed and flicker
	* Turned the debug windows off, there's barely a need for them now
	* Fixed password masking - was still showing up in the MUD window
	* Added FrmPreference
	* Added Config class
	* Added ability to set the Window Font and the command seperator
	* Aggregated out the Connection class to get ready for multiple MUDs in one window
	
Version 0.3 - 9/13/2004
	* Finished implementing Password masking
	* Moved all ANSI stuff into it's own Windows control called AnsiEdit
	* Added code to make updating AnsiEdit control much much faster
	
Version 0.2 - 9/12/2004
Lolindrath
	* Implemented Bell
	* Half finished Password masking

Version 0.1 - 9/11/2004
Lolindrath
	* Added socket to Main.cs so that GetSocket() wouldn't be called so often
	* Added About window
	* Switched from KeyUp to KeyPress for cmbInput so I could squelch the beep
	* I think I fixed a weird bug where extra text would be kept at the bottom
	  I'm pretty sure this was caused by not doing an SelectionStart = 0 before
	  SelectionRTF += "whatever"
	  
Version 0.0 - 9/10/2004 
Lolindrath
	* Fixed Bug #1
	* Added Escaping for { and }
	* In input text box switched to TrimEnd instead of SubString
	* Added Disconnect() method to Main.cs
